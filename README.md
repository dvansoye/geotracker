# geotracker
geotracker code used to update location on website map

Custom code of the trekkingtheplanet.com website

geotracker is a simple "glue" program that sits in between OSMAND and Google Maps Easy.

Basically, it takes that lat, lon and other parameters that it receives from OSMAND and pushes them into the GME table in MySQL.

I have removed the User ID and Password from the code. Thus, you need to update this before copying it to the root of the website that you want to activate.
